# What is an operating system?

An operating system (**OS**) is systmen software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides services for computer programs.
 Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.

 For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes systems calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer - from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.

 The dominant desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows..

 ## Single-tasking and Multi-tasking

 A single-tasking system can only run one program at a time, while a multi-tasking operating system allows more than one program to be running in concurrency. This is achieved by time-sharing, where the available processor time is divided between multiple processes. These processes are each interrupted repeatedly in time slices by task-scheduling subsystem of the operating system. Multi-tasking may be characterized in preemptive and co-operating types.

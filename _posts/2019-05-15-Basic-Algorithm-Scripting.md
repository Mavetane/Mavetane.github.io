## What is an Algorithm?

A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especiall by a computer. The other explanation is as follows:
A computer algorithm is a sequence of steps that is followed to achieve a particular outcome. To write an algorithm, you must first understand a problem, and then solve it with coding. 

Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks. As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and intial input, the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-difined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state.

The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.

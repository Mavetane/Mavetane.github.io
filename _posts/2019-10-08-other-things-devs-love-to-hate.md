# Things Devs love to hate continues

## Meetings

Too many meetings or inefficiently run meetings are just as detrimental to productivity as interruptions (probably more so in many cases). The meeting that could have taken 10 minutes, but took an hour. The meeting that could have been replaced with an email. The meeting without a clear objective or agenda
The meeting where people keep bringing up new topics and extending the length. The unnecessary motivational meeting. The red tape meeting that you have to attend but has nothing to do with your work.

Meetings and interruptions all throughout the day are common reasons for working late into the night. It's the only time developers can get the isolation and long stretches of focused time needed to finish projects. Sometimes the amount of meetings gets so bad that developers look forward to the weekend, not because they get a break from work, but because they can actually get some work done!

## Other people's bad code

Just like writers, programmers have their own individual styles, and the tendency is to transform any code they see into something that aligns with that. There are strong opinions across the industry about whitespace, method naming, and a host of other things that might seem like minutiae to an outsider.
Developers certainly don't hate everyone's code but their own. Most have to learn by examining and admiring more experienced programmers' code. However, diving into the code of a programmer who didn't do a very good job can be traumatic. Sometimes the programmer wasn't very good, while other times they just got lazy. Either way, it's a nightmare scenario when you have to maintain or refactor that code.

The biggest challenge is the amount of time it takes to wrap your head around someone else's architecture and thought process. It's especially hard when the previous developer didn't create any documentation explaining how everything worked or didn't build any unit or integration tests, which would also give clues about the user flow. Code without comments can also be really hard to understand.
The solution for preventing these scenarios lies with the original programmer. 

*"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live. Code readability."*, John F.Woods

## Documentation

It looks like we're at an impasse. Nothing is worse for developers who are trying to learn about some platform, library, framework, or piece of code than confusing, badly organized, or outdated documentation. Unsurprisingly, documentation written with haste (or, lose the "s"â€”with HATE) will probably turn out bad. So what's the solution?Teams need to nurture a documentation author. It could be a developer who's better at writing than the rest. Or just someone who doesn't hate writing documentation as much as the other team members. It doesn't always have to be a developer, and it shouldn't be forced on them if it's not necessary.

Either way, someone on the team needs to bite the bullet and get good at writing documentation. It's the only way to start producing good documentation and end the vicious cycle. Plus, it's a great skill that can differentiate some developers and result in a higher salary.

# My thoughts

It was really an impromtu test indeed. But time was the biggest enemy too, as a wiseman once said "Time waits for no man". Just today I was in no-man's land. Anyways it was a fun challenge on the description but hard when it comes to writing logic for it, an iceberg illusion indeed..

The reason I titled "My thoughts" is that today's blog post is about my thoughts regarding the test I wrote today and I would highly appreciate if they were acknowledged without a second thought.. Honestly I've never written a full stack application in five hours.. The last time I did somethings similar to this it took me a week and still I didn't get it right by the end of the week.

From that I could conclude that I was more focussed on front-end rather than back-end which the reason for the next sub-heading.

## Frontend vs Backend

Let me bite the bullet and spit it out.. I'm weaker on backend than on front-end and not that I master front-end but at least I have an idea or ideas on the flow works. This entire week I've been improving my skills on redux and learning to combine redux with react hooks, what I was not aware of was that I was turning a complete blind eye on backend up to date, honestly it has never crossed my mind.

I gave it my all even though it's dissapointing to me I wonder what it will do to the next person reading it. As much as I don't like mentioning it but "TIME" was a rival today. It really was from the time I started I looked at the time and the instructions then thought "I'll never make it in time", as absurd as it sounds it was true at the end of the day..
I'm willing to face the dawn of the new week with rejuvinated strength and retake the challange on my own again for five hours and see what happens when I face it with my boots fully tied on

### Intentions

My intentions to it were pure and will still be pure when we clash on monday.. I intend on downloading vedios to watch during the weekend and only the essentials.. This weekend is tuturial-horror-weekend and I'm prepered for it. Till we meet again.

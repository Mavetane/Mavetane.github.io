# Bright Future App

Hey folks today I decided to write about this weeks project. We were required to build an app which takes in a sql(Structured Query Language) string and return the results of the submitted query. It was quite a learning curve. We we're introduced to new stuff like sql and not only sql but Microsoft sql. It was nice working on something different for a change and the fact that we had no test this week kinda rejuvinated my strenght in terms of thinking and productivity.

The other thing I didn't mention was that this was a team work and the team did really good. We only started working on the project yesterday and and we're almost through with it today. And I'm confident to say it is ready for presentation on Monday, Forgive there folks I forgot there was no I in team-work.
I was covering the frontend part with Maggie and the other guys were doing the backend. At first I thought we would never make through but I soon realized that team-work makes the dream-work.

## RESTful Web Service

One more thing I want to keep improving in 2019 is my knowledge about writing REST API and implementing secure and scalable RESTful Web Service in Java using Sring
This one skill which is highly desirable in the Java world and there are not many people who know both Java and REST well.

## Spring Security 5.0

This is the third major upgrade on Spring Eco-system. The 5th version of popular security framework has several bug fixes and a major OAuth 2 module, which you just can't miss.
 
## Angular 2+ or React JS

These two JavaScript framework has completely change how you develop web applications.

## Andriod

If you don't know how to write Android Apps in 2019 then you are lacking something. Mobile is one of the best platforms to reach a large number of people and Android is probably the most popular platform to write mobile applications.

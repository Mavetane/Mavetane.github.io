#My week so far
Hey there hope you all good, my week at the TCG was not as easy as chasing a tortoise but i learned so much about coding within a short period of time.
I was taught about HTML and CSS which is a brand new world to me, the other thing i picked up on my own about computers is that they always follow the programm and believe me or not coding is more than the word itself.

## Meeting new people
I used to spend most of my days alone, you can call me a loner but not anymore because I met this new crew and guess what? i injoy their company and their principles, one of the things i like most about them is loyalty and respect.

### Exploring the cyber world
The cyber world is a very great place where learning is made simple and enjoyable, Exploring this cyber world was not an easy peacy lemon squeezy thing

### My week so far
Hello there hope you all good, my week at the TCG was not as easy as chasing a tortoise but i learned so much about coding within a short period of time.I was taught about HTML and CSS which is a brand new world to me, the other thing i picked up on my own about computers is that they always follow the programme, they are reliable but not trustworthy and believe me or not coding is more fun than the word itself.Some of the elements I enjoyed most were that of CSS 'padding,margins and borders.The typing practise is fun, if one loses track of time they might find themselve's doing it the whole day.

### Meeting new people
I used to spend most of my days alone, you can call me a loner but not anymore because I met this new crew and guess what? I injoy their company and their principles, one of the things I like most about them is loyalty and respect.The coding Ground (TCG) students work as a team and they encouraged me that team work archive's the dream  work.The TCG is not giving a hungry man a fish, instead they teach him how to fish and here I am writting my first blog post.

### Exploring the cyber world
The cyber world is a very great place where learning is made simple and enjoyable, Exploring this cyber world was not an easy peacy lemon squeezy thing. This world has an evolution of it's own, it has it's unique and fascinating areas where the work of fiction is mixed up with technology, It also has its bumps and turns of tantrums where some masters believe that if all you ever gave was a hammer then every thing they see is a nail.What fascinates me more about this world is that the laws of evolution apply, from Natural selection to the law of use and dis-use.

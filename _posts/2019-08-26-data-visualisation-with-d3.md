#D3.js

Data-Driven Documents is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in we browsers. It makes use of the  widely implemented Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), HTML5, and Cascading styling sheets (CSS) standards. It is the successor to the earlier Protovis framework. In contrast to many other library, D3.js allows great control over the final visual result. Its development was noted in 2011, as version 2.0.0 released in August 2011.

D3.js is used on hundreds of thousands of websites. Some popular users include creating interactive graphics for online news websites, information dashboards for viewing data, and producing maps from **GIS map making** data. In addition, hte exportable nature of SVG enables graphics created by D3 to be used in print publicatins.

##Context
There have been various previous attemps to bring data visualization to web browsers. The most notable examples were the Prefuse, Flare, and Protovis toolkits, which can all be considered as direct predecessors of D3.js
Prefuse was a visualization toolkit created in 2005 that required usage of Java, and visualization were rendered with browsers with a Java plug-in. Flare was a similar toolkit from 2007 that used **Action script**, and required a Flash plug-in for rendering

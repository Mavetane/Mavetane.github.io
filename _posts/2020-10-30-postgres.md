# Postgres

This week's post is about a new database I was learning or obliged to learn so should I say. The reason I chose to write about it is that I had no challenges during the week till today. It's funny because we only recieved a task about 2 days ago and I was already hands on. My words today are like a toddler in a tiara, precious but short.. 

The problem I faced was connecting the database to my server. I was beating about the bush cluesless on what the problem was for almost 2 hours. Luckily I had done my database setup yesterday. So I had tables and columns awaiting to be connect which didn't come easily. Well I had a problem with my connection string and the only thing missing from it was quotes that should wrap the string. 

The error though was something different. It kept on whinning about password authentication failed. But it makes sense now if the string is undefined how is the machine supposed to know which password is which. But after doing some debugging I came to realise that my string was undefined and just as I fixed that the code worked. I now I can run sql queries against my database and it's sweet.

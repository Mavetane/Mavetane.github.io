# What is a timestamp

A *timestamp* is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occured, usually giving date and time of the day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from rubber stamps used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received. 

In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data. For example, computer files contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and digital cameras add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

### Collen Maphike
Dr Albert Einstein once said and I quote "If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live it's whole life believing it is useless, believing it is stupid".
Ladies and gentlemen of the *cyber world* today I proudly present to you my second blog post, barring in mind the fact that it takes courage to build a legacy. I've lived my whole life without a machine but that did not change my ambition towards being a software developer.

## Ambition vs Passion 
I, myself and no Ghandi have always been ambitious about being a programmer, you know what they say **"fortune favors the bold"** and when I had a chance to express my ambition I just stood by the machine wide eyed like a mothley demon stunned by the first burst of spring light.
This is the most exciting journey I've encounted in my very short life.
To be honest I was passionate about computers, they are fascinating little wants which most of those who are not born with a silver spoons desire, but we try by all means to understand them even though every effort we make seems like pissing into the the wind. I guess it was a stae of amition vs passion.

## Coding 
It seems complicated than it's explanation but as you do it more often it becomes part of you like an orgasim, trust me 'been there,done that', it requires a certain aspect of understanding the machines and their nature. It's like there is a link between them and humans which most of us cannot understand even though they were invented by humans their evolution is way faster than ours', I mean their masters because they always follow our programme.
Their' fascinating creatures of their own and I hope to understand them in the course of time, as a matter of fact I wish to follow them till the end of time. 

## JavaScript Strings
Strings are useful for holding data that can be presented in text form. Some of the most-used  operations on strings are to check their *length*, to build a concentrated using '+' and *+=string operators*, checking for the existance or location of substrings with the *indexof()* method, or extracting substrings with the *substring()*method.

### String comparison
Code dvelopers have the *strcmp()* function for  comparing strings. In Javascript, you just use the *less-than and greater-than operators*.
How ever a similar result can be archievd by using the *locale-compare* method inherited instances.

### String primitives and String objects
String literals (denoted by double or single quotes) and strings returned from string calls in a non-constructor contex(i.e without using the new keyword) are primitive strings.
JavaScript automatically converts primitivesto string objects, so that its possible to use string object methods for prmitive string or a property lookup occurs, JavaScript will automatically wrap the string primitive and call the method to perform the property lookup.
String primitives and string objects also give different results when using *eval()*. Primitives passed to eval are treated as all other objects are, by returnig the object.

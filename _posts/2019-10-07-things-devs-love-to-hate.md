# Things developers love to hate

## "Just one more thing"

Having too many of these last-minute additions to a project can often lead to feature creep. To prevent this, a team needs to understand an idea most developers truly believe in—the Unix philosophy. It’s pretty simple: Just do one thing really well. Software, or at least the components of a software product, should do the same. One product can’t please everyone.

## Poor QA

Developers build code; QA breaks code. It’s not hard to see where the conflict originates. Imagine being five years old, you’ve just finished the Mona Lisa of wooden block towers, and here comes your jerk of a younger sibling. They represent the QA tester in this fantasy, who rams into your tower at full speed, destroying the masterpiece you’ve spent the last 20 minutes carefully crafting. Do you understand? That’s the kind of trauma that QA can bring about.

But let’s remember that there are a lot of good testers out there, and they are worth their weight in gold. If a good tester is annoying you, it’s probably a good thing. They force you to become a better developer, and they’ll save your butt when you screw up royally.

## Interruptions

Developers don’t wear headphones because they enjoy music more than other people. They do it to shut out distracting noise and to prevent interruptions. It’s in lieu of having a sign on the back of their head that says, “LEAVE ME ALONE! I’M CODING!”.Interruptions are detrimental for all knowledge workers, but they are especially bad for programmers because of the mental models they need to maintain.

## Bad bosses

Pointy-haired bosses are real. They’re the bosses who think that because they know a little bit about a lot of things, they are experts in everything (especially UI design). They make assumptions that make no sense and have zero basis in reality. These assumptions can result in arbitrary organizational constraints on language, platform, libraries, and other technology choices. Everyone understands that being a manager is tough, but some don’t follow basic principles that could make everyone a lot happier and more motivated.

Developers hate too much management—where they are caught in nonstop meetings that result in lost time and constant direction changes in the software, which also wastes time. Developers hate micromanagement, where managers are asking for time estimates every hour and trying to find out where every second of your day is spent. Developers also hate not having enough management—a team without structured processes will be in constant pain because no one is in sync and tasks are being forgotten.

The good development managers of the world won’t set unreasonable deadlines; it’s usually the non-technical ones that do that. They will listen to developers and give them the benefit of the doubt, because the manager will acknowledge that they’re not the expert. Most important, managers will give developers a good amount of autonomy without letting the team be completely structureless.

## Everything is top priority

Some people forget what the word prioritize means. It means ranking tasks and projects—in no uncertain terms—for your developers. But many of the bad examples of managers, like the ones illustrated in the last section, are too afraid to choose. They assume that if they prioritize one task over another, the lower priority task won’t get done on time (reality check—sure, sometimes it won’t). It’s nothing more than wishful thinking. They’ll say that individuals can just work on multiple things “in parallel,” as if saying this magically gives them the ability to code two things simultaneously.

Often, managers will add new "top-priority" tasks to the developers’ plates and still expect other ongoing tasks to be finished on time. “Why did we forget about this task?” they’ll ask. Few people think about the reality behind adding tasks or routines, which is that something needs to be tabled or removed permanently from your day in order to make room for the new work.

So many developers have to live in a world where everything is top priority. This way, it’s easier for the manager to blame the developers when something isn’t finished on time. The manager can just say that the task that the developers silently decided not to prioritize was "top priority". They should’ve known. The manager was very clear.

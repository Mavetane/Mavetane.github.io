# How it felt like.

Honestly the first week after quaranteen was a bit hush. Firstly code came in fragments due to lack of practice, It is always fun to do code more especially if you know what you are doing but the problem begins once you start doubting your self or having second thoughts about every single line of code you write.


## C-sharp

Two weeks later a new a new project showed up. The program is in c-sharp and I had no clue what it meant or how it looked like but with google I was able to read a couple of documentations. The tricky part was that not only was I going to do c-sharp but automation as well. It was food for thought the whole day.. 

Automation did work, I was able automate chrome and send an email using the very same code.. I have to accept it was not easy work for a starter. I was told to run the very same process headless which I'm still stuck at now. It's been three day's and not way out.. Read every documentation I could.. Watched every tuturial covering selenium and c# but still no break through.

I'm not ready to bite the dust on it yet for I know my mind was little rusty, not that rusty but thinking in code was about to become a foreign concept but I'm glad to say I'm regaining what I have lost during the lockdown and with the dawn of a new week I'm hoping I will get it right this time..

You know what they say, "wherever the mind leads the body will follow

# What is a callback function?

A **callback**, also known as a "call-after" function, is any executable code that is passed as an argument to other code that is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time. 
This execution may be immediate as in a sychronous callback, or it might happen at a later time as in an **asynchronous callback**. In simple terms we can say that A callback function is  a function that you pass to someone and let them call it at some point in time. In other words we can say is a reference to executable code, or a piece of executable code , that is passed as an argument to other code.

# Asynchronous await

The occurrence of events independent of the main program flow and ways to deal with such events. These may be outside events such as the arrival of signals, or actions instigated by a program that take place concurrently with program execution, without the program *blocking* to wait for results. Lets programs issue commands to storage or network devices that service these requests while the processor continues executing the program. Doing so provides a degree of prallelsim.

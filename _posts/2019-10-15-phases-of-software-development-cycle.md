# 7 phases of the software development life cycle

## Planning

Planning focuses on the scope of the project. The outputs of the planning phase include: **projects plans, schedules, cost estimations, and procurement requirements**.

## Requirements

The IT team gathers requirements from business stakeholders and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The output of this phase in a Waterfall project is usually a document that lists these requirements. Agile methods, by contrast, may produce a backlog of tasks to be performed.

## Design and prototyping

Once requirements are understood, the design process takes place. It makes use of established patterns for application architecture and software development. Architecture frameworks like TOGAF may be used here. Outputs include: design documents that list the patterns and components selected for the project, code produced by spikes, used as a starting point for development.

## Software development

This phase produces the software under development. This could be in "sprints" (Agile). or a single block effort (Waterfall). The output of this phase is testable, functional software.

## Testing

The testing phase of the SDLC is arguable one of the most important. It is impossible to deliver quality software without testing. Methods for testing can include: code quality, unit testing(functional tests). Intergration testing, Performance testing, Security testing. The output of the testing phase is functional sofware, ready for deployment to a production environment.

## Deployment

The deployment phase is, ideally, a highly automated phase. In high-maturity enterprises, this phase is almost invinsible; software is deployed the instat it is ready. Enterprises with lower maturity, or in some highly regulated industries, the process involves some manual approvals. The output of this phase is the release to Production of working software.

## Operations and maintenance

The operations and maintanance phase is the "end of the beginning. Through the SDLC doesn't end here. Software must be monitored constantly to ensure proper operation. Bugs and defects discovered in Production must be reported and responded to, which often feeds work back into the process. Bug fixes may not flow through the entire cycle, however, at least an abbreviated process process is necessary to ensure that the fix does not introduce other problems.

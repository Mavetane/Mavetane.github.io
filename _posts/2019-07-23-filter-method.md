#Filter (higher-order-function)
 Filter is a higher-order function that processes a data structure (usually a list) in some order to produce a new data structure containing exactly those elements fo the original data structure for which a given predictable returns the boolean value.
 One can think of filter as a *for* loop, that is specifically for filtering in/out certain values from an array. 

 Filter creates its results without modifying the original list. Many programmng languages also provide variants that destructively modify the list argument instead for faster performance. In short I can say filter returns a new array created from all elements that pass a certain test preformed on an original array.

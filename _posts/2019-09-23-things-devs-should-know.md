# Data Structures and Algorithms

If you want to become a programmer then you ought to know data structure and algorithms well; there's no way around it.
This is one of the important topics of any programming job interview and without you knowing basic data structures (e.g. array, linked list, map, set) it's not possible to write a real-world application.

That's why every programmer should put serious effort to learn data structures and algorithms during their computer science course.
Even If you are a self-teaching programming yourself, then also you must know data structures and algorithms; in fact, many programming bootcamps will teach you data structures and algorithms as the first thing.

# Source Control (Git)

Source control is used to store your code and helps programmer to colloborate within team. For example, if many progarmmer are working in same codebase but on different feature then source control tools like Git helps them to colloborate without overriding each other chagnes. In short, if you want to become a coder or software developer, you must know version control tools like Git or SVN.
Thankfully Git and Github have streamlined the market and now more than 70% of organizations use Git, so you can probably get away by just learning Git.

# Text Editors

There is not a single day when I have not used a text editor like Vim while working as a programmer or Software developer. It's one of the most essential tools even for non-programmers like DBAs and System Admins, and anyone who works with computers.
I have mostly used NotePad on Windows and VIm in Linux, but you have a lot of choices available in terms of advanced editors like Sublime and NotePad++, which provides IDE-like functionalities.

#  IDEs

In other words, IDEs like IntelliJIDEA or AndroidStudio is the single most important tool for any programmers. For C, C++, and C# programmer, the choice is clear: Visual Studio. And for Python developers, Jupiter Notebook is getting better and better every day.
For Java programmers, there are three major IDEs to choose: Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ IDEA.
While Eclipse is my favorite, IntelliJ IDEA is probably the most powerful of them.

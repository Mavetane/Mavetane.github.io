# Database and SQL

SQL is a classic and probably the most valuable skill for any software developer. It's been around for more than 30 years and I think it will be around for another 30 years. Given the omnipresence of the database, it's expected from a programmer that he is familiar with essential database concepts like normalization and table design along with SQL.
There are many databases like Oracle, Micrsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, but knowing just one is enough. The key point is that you should be familiar with the database. You should know how to insert/update/delete data and write SQL queries to retrieve it.

# UNIX or Linux

Like SQL, UNIX also has withstood the test of time. It's also been around for more than 30 years and I hope it will be there for many more coming years.
Since most programmers have to work in Linux machines at some point, good knowledge of Linx command line goes a long way.
It allows you to work effectively. You can search files, know what's going on with the system by checking its CPU and memory usage, and perform basic and advance task.

# Microsoft Excel

I may get a lot of flaks for including Excel in this list but I still thing that Excel is one of the king tools for programmers, software developers, project manager, traders, and business guys. It's much more than just spreadsheet software.
It provides many useful features and functions to perform sophisticated data analysis.I have used Excel to track progress, reconcile data, data science, data quality checks and for project planning.
It has several uses and that's why I urge every programmer to learn Excel in depth. Instead of just copying and pasting data, you should know basic functions like searching, sorting, filtering and VLOOKUP to compare stuff.

# Programming Languages

Ofcourse, if you want to become a programmer than you must know a programming language: C++ or Java, or maybe Python or JavaScript. You can choose whatever you want to but my personal suggestion is that you should at least know Java.
It's very easy to start with and that's why a good choice for beginners. It's also immensely powerful and allows you to virtually anything.
It has got libraries from doing basic stuff like web development to more complex tasks with Big Data and so on. If you decide to learn Java then The Complete Java MasterClass is probably the best place to start with.

# Networking Basics

Today's world is a inter-connected world and anywhere you go, you will find computer networks, starting from your home, where you are using Wi-Fi across many devices, to schools, college, and offices which use Local Area Network (LAN) to the Internet.
Most of the applications you will write like Web applications or Mobile apps will also not be standalone but client-server kind of application where the request will go through the network to a server. Clients will access your application from anywhere in the world.

#  Scripting Languages

Well, there are certainly some Programming languages which are good for both OOP coding and scripting like Python, and that's why I asked you to learn them at least.
But if you happen to choose C/C++ or Java then you can't whip out something as quickly as a Python or Perl developer can do.

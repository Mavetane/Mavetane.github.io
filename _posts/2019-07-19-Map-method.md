## What is a map method?
map() takes each element from an original array, transforms it with a function that you specify, and adds the result to a new array in the same order. ... But using map() will allow you to write less code and make your code more readable. 

JavaScript includes these built-in Array methods – including the Map Method – for a reason. It’s not a secret that when you’re programming in JavaScript you’ll probably be dealing with arrays a lot, and chances are you’ll find yourself transforming those arrays quite often. Having utility methods like the Map Method that operates on Arrays not only help us to drastically cut down on the amount of typing that we need to do, they help our code become more readable (in many cases) by having us only describe the part of the loop that will actually change each time we’re transforming array data: the transformation which is the business logic of the callback function passed to the map method.

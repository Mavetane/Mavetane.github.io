# "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to be a descent programmer"

It might seem hard but the truth is... It can be easier than you think. you just have to read, practice, and put some effort. But.. Isn't what you do on a daily basis


## The Basics

First thing's first. Befor you even start troubling your mind for a semicolon (maybe you won't get this now, but believe me. You'll get it later on) you'll need a good computer science basics resource and a good text editor.


## Git

Git is a version control system to... Well, maintain versions of your code. It allows you to go back to another version if you ever change something and anything goes wrong on the new one. This website is a good place to start learning git.

## Github

This is a very important resource. Almost every programming company asks you to have experience with some sort of version control system. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It also allows you to collaborate with other programmers. You could also use it as a static HTML hosting to store your personal projectâ€™s files. You can actually serve a website from within Github.

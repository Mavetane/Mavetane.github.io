# Markdown

Markdown is a lightwweight markup language with plain text formmating syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format **readme files**, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create **rich text** using a **plain text editor**. Since the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, the implementations that appeared over the years have subtle differences and many come with syntax extensions. 
In application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn't like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For instance, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it(e.g *# Heading One*). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it. It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you're accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

##  WYSIWYG applications

(What You See Is What You Get) is a system where editing software allows content to be edited in a form that resembles its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation. It implies a user interface that allows the user to view something very similar to the end result-while the document is being created. In general it implies the ability to directly manipulate the layout of a document, without having to type or remember names of layout commands. The actual meaning depends on the user's perspective.
In many situations, the subtle differnces between what the user sees and what the user gets are unimportant. In fact, applications may offer multiple WYIWYG modes with different levels of **"realism"**.

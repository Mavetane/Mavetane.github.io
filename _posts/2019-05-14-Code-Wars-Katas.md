## What are Katas
Kata, a Japanese word, meaning literally: "form", is a detailed choreographed pattern of movements made to be practiced alone. Folks this is the logical meaning of a Kata but with code wars Katas are a series of challanges which one must complete in order to gain ranks, not only ranks though but experience as a junior developer or coder.

These Katas have different levels arccording to ones experience, curiosity or ambition. They are offerd in different programming languages and some which are not recongnized by pawns like myself.
They are used to assess ones progress and understanding when it comes to writting and reading code. They are helpful since when ones mentors or teacher can be able to see their students progress and determination when it comes to coding.

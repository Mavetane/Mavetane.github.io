## What are Katas
Kata, a Japanese word, meaning literally: "form", is a detailed choreographed pattern of movements made to be practiced alone. Folks this is the logical meaning of a Kata but with code wars Katas are a series of challanges which one must complete in order to gain ranks, not only ranks though but experience as a junior developer or coder.

These Katas have different levels arccording to ones experience, curiosity or ambition. They are offerd in different programming languages and some which are not recongnized by pawns like myself.
They are used to assess ones progress and understanding when it comes to writting and reading code. They are helpful since when ones mentors or teacher can be able to see their students progress and determination when it comes to coding.

One is placed in a group with those on the same level as him/her and the group is called a clan and the can form Allies who compete for the position on rank. They practice almost the same Katas and the difficulty increases over time. Whenever a challange is complete one can look for other solutions from others who have done it aready, however the solutions cannot be displayed if one had not completed their Kata or else they will have to forfeit and loose the points which will be gained after the Kata is complete.

Those of the same clan can even communicate with the online slacker app.

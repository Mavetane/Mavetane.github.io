# Exponential reccursion

Straight talk doesn't break any friendship and I hope is spares my career. I was never a huge fan of Math or should I say Math is not a huge fan of me or is because I never studied pure Math at school. I was expecting an open book test like the spread sheets shown but instead I had a jaw-dropping experience, it was the other way round.
The question was simple and clear but yet seemed complicated.

I dont' need to be told for I know deep down in me that I did pretty bad with this task. I had to make things right and revisit the past. Revise what I thought I knew about JavaScript..

During the visit I came upon a blog post of someone who hated Math like myself.. And as the saying goes "The enemy of my enemy is my friend", it had a clear explanation of exponential reccursion and from that I soon learned that I had missed a second parameter not only the second parameter was wrong from my side but the logic as well. From this code:

*const computeExponent = (base, powerOfNumber) => {*
  *if (powerOfNumber === 0) {*
   *return 1*
  }*
  *return base * computeExponent(base, powerOfNumber - 1)*
}

*const recursion = (number) => {*
  *console.log(number)*
  *if (number == 0) {*
    *return*
  *}*
  *return recursion(number - 1)*
*}*
*console.log(recursion(10))*


I relized that I was only three sheets to the wind even though I had left out the *if* statements.. But It was an eye opener for I had to fill in from where I left and It was a moment for a bunch of **uhuhs**.
I believe I can do it right this time around for I made sure that I grab what is essential.. Once bitten twice shy...

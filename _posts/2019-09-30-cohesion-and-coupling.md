# Cohesion

Cohesion refers to what the class (or module) can do. Low cohesion would mean that the class does a great variety of actions - it is broad, unfocused on what it should do. High cohesion means that the class is focused on what it should be doing, i.e. only methods relating to the intention of the class.
Cohesion is the indication of the relationship within module.Cohesion shows the module’s relative functional strength.Cohesion is a degree (quality) to which a component / module focuses on the single thing.
While designing you should strive for high cohesion i.e. a cohesive component/ module focus on a single task (i.e., single-mindedness) with little interaction with other modules of the system.
Cohesion is the kind of natural extension of data hiding for example, class having all members visible with a package having default visibility. Cohesion is Intra – Module Concept.

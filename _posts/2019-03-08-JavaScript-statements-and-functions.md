title:  JavaScript Statements

Statements are used in JavaScript to control its program flow. Unlike properties, methods, and events, which are fundamentally tied to the object that owns them, statements are designed to work independently of any JavaScript object. That means you can use a statement whether you're working with the document object, the window object, the history object, or some other object. As a language, JavaScript supports relatively few statements -- just enough to get by. 
It does, however, offer the bare minimum of statements that are needed to construct a fully-functional application. Statements consist a variables and strings which are used to assign a code to something.
**i.e var name="your-text"**
The **consol.log()** is used to validate or check your progress in the terminal.

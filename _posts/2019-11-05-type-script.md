# What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language.
TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution.

TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like *c++* header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statcally typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as *jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js*. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.

# Object-oriented design

Good design is paramount to extensible, bug-free, durable code. We know it’s possible to solve any software problem in an almost limitless number of ways, but when software needs to be extensible and maintainable, good software design is critical to success. One way to build lasting software is to use object-oriented design best practices. You should have a working knowledge of a few common and useful design patterns and know how to write software in an object-oriented way. You probably won’t be asked to give detailed descriptions of how specific design patterns work, but expect to have to defend your design choices.

# Databases

Most of the software that we write is backed up on a data-storage system. Many of the challenges faced by tech people arise when figuring out how to most efficiently retrieve and store data for future use. Amazon has been at the forefront of the non-relational DB movement. We have made Amazon Web Services such as DynamoDB available to the developer community so that they can easily leverage the benefits of non-relational databases. While we don't expect any particular level of expertise in non-relational databases, you should be familiar with general database concepts and their applications. The more you know about trade-offs between relational and non-relational databases, the better prepared you will be.

# Distributed Computing

Systems at Amazon have to work under very strict tolerances at a high load. While we have some internal tools that help us with scaling, you should be familiar with a few basic distributed computing concepts. Having an understanding of topics such as service-oriented architectures, map reduce, distributed caching and load balancing will help you to answer some of the more complicated distributed architecture questions you might be asked.

# Pomodoro Technique
The **Pomodoro Technique** is a *time management* method developed by **Francesco Cirillo** in the late 1980s.
The technique uses a *timer* to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
Each interval is known as *pomodoro*, after the tomatoe-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions.
Closley related to concepts such as *timeboxing* and *iterative and incremental development* used in software design, the method has been adopted in *pair programming* contexts.

## Underlying principles
*1. Decide on the task to be done.*
*2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).*
*3. Work in the task*
*4. End work when the timer rings and put a chechmark on an piece of paper*.
*5. If you have a fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3-5 minutes), then go to step*.
*6.  After four pomodori (plural of pomodoro), take a longer break (15-30 minutes),reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1*.

## Tools
The creator and his proponents encourage a low-tech approach,using a mechanical timer, paper, and pencil. 
The physical act of winding the timer confirms the user's determination to start the task, ringing announces a break.
**Flow** and**focus** become associated with these physical stimuli.

# Full stack

The concept "full stack" is scary on its own but once one familiarises themselves with the concept it becomes more of a walk in a park but with certain complexities. By walk in a park I don't mean you just write code and magic happens. One has to look at the path they are walking like which correct dependencies to install and how to make a correct connection between the front-end and back-end. Same thing as walking in an actual park one has to be careful not step on children by accident nor slip on the stairs and hurt themselves.


## Redux 

I was never confindent enough with my redux and after this project I feel my understanding for redux is a bit clear and it's no longer confusing as it was a couple months back. I still have to admit though Lockdown took some of my coding and quaranteened it. Of course it was never an excuse for me because I managed to implement it and to my surprise it worked.. I had a lot of doubts about myself though, after all what are we without second thoughts and I have learned that proper preperations prevent poor perfomance.. Not to say my perfomance was excellent but it was rather fluent from my part of writing code and with that being said I'm glad..

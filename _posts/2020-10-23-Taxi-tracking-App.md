# React Native

This week I've been busy with React Native. This is the first time I work with this framework and the first time I'm building a real live app. The reason or reasons I titled this section React Native is because I feel like a native now. I never thougth it was gonna be so much fun. I like how one can develop for smartphones without having to sweat on it. I mean the world out there is dominated by smartphones and computers but If we were to be realisitic we would come to see that it is somewhat tricky to request a ride from a computer. So reacti natve closes the deal on that one..


## Tracking App

We were asked to build this app a couple weeks before the government decided on lock-down and ever since then no one said a word about it. So decided to embark on a one man voyage and see what the sea of React-Native is made of. Apparently it's made of sugar and spice and everything nice. But there is always an uphill slope which I have to over come now and again.. For example the errors are new to me so I spend a lot of time on errors than writing code itself. 
Nevertheless I've managed to get the home screen up and running with google maps and to my surprise I can detect the users location from the app, Of course I ask for their permission first! 

I'm defenitely hoping the next coming week is going to be awesome for as there is a lot of work to be done and there is a lot of learning to take place. I had quite a fair week so far, I can't complain at all...

They who suffer the least complains the most!

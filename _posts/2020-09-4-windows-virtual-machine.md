# What is a virtual machine?

A virtual is a computer file in simple terms, it is typically called an image that behaves or acts like an actual computer.. Each virtual machine has its own virtual hardware, which inludes CPU's, hardrives and network drives.
The reason I chose to write about a virtual machine is that I have been battling to get it right for ages, It didn't come that easy though. After all it was created

## Network connection

I've been asked to build a windows 10 virtual machine with a 4 GB RAM and 20GB HDD, Like I said before and I'm still saying it again it wasn't that easy builing a virtual machine. The sole purpose of this machine was to help with automation since when ubuntu kinda sucks at that. There is always a catcher in the rye or a setback I should say. I was able load the image after a hundred tries and errors but when it started working I got so overwhelmed and thought my troubles were over only to realize they had just started

I had a tough time connecting the machine to the internet which I would still be doing today if not of the test I wrote, The reason I'm not writing about the test is that it was long and hard.
I'm hoping by monday I'll be writing another blog post on how I managed to connect it to the internet with a more detailed explanation.
